Calculate the double threshold of the maximum entropy of the remote sensing image to be segmented, and use cuckoo optimization.
This code is a batch calculation script
In this code:
1. read TIFF images
2. Calculating the TSVD and got multiple components
3. Compute double thresholds for the first component based on maximum entropy
4. Use cuckoo search to get the best result
